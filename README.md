## 👋🏽 Hi there! I'm Meri.

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/553ZGCzYHSQHXiFKA8/giphy.gif" alt="cat sitting on laptop" align="right" width="20%"/>

👩🏻‍💻  I currently work as a **Frontend Developer** but I have also worked for over 10 years as a **Digital Marketing Specialist** at Tech & Innovation companies and nonprofits. I'm curious about everything and love solving problems, which is why I have so much fun coding. 

📜  I also have a Bachelor's degree in Audiovisual Communications and am really close to getting my Philosophy degree.

🚀  I'm looking forward to joining a creative dev team and building innovative mind-blowing solutions, so feel free to reach out!
