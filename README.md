👩🏻‍💻  I'm taking my first steps as a **Front-End Developer** (yay!) and have been working for over 10 years as a **Digital Marketing Specialist**. I'm curious about everything and love solving problems, which is why I have so much fun coding.

🚀  I'm looking forward to joining a creative dev team and building innovative mind-blowing solutions, so feel free to reach out!
